# https://yanaga.io

This is the source code for my https://yanaga.io website.

I'm using [JeKyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) to build and host it.

## Localhost development

I'm using the instructions from [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to build and test the site locally before pushing my changes.

This is the only command you have to execute:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
