["97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048824.do) is a book published by O'Reilly that is scheduled to be released in May 2020.

As the title suggests, it collects 97 expert advices from Java leaders and practitioners to push the reader's Java skills to the next level.

And I just happened to be one of these Java practitioners. :-)

Just in case you're wondering "why 97", Kevlin Henney (one of the editors) has the answer:

I chose to write about one of my favorite subjects regarding software development: _inconsistent state_. That's why I titled it "Behavior Is 'Easy', State Is Hard".

If you're interested, it's a very quick read also published on [Medium](https://medium.com/97-things/behavior-is-easy-state-is-hard-b272356cf867).

But of course I still recommend you to buy the book. ;-)
